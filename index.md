I live in Perth, Western Australia. My education to date is vast are varied. In previous years I have studied Visual Art (Cert III), Multimedia (Cert III and IV), Performance Music (Cert III, IV, and Diploma), Music Business (Cert IV), and an introductory course into Automotive Mechanics (Cert II). Over the past 5 months I have been teaching myself Spanish as I have recently returned from a trip to Mexico.
In my free time I write and play music in a band and am part way though building a modular synthesiser. I also design and print 3d models, such as parts for a remote control camera drone.
